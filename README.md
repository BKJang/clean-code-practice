# do-you-know-vanilla

:banana: This repository contains contents about Vanilla JS and project developed with `Vanilla JS`.

I have written the contents of `Vanilla JS` in the issues section and related simple projects link to each repository via a README.

The goal of this repository is to understand `Vanilla JS` and to become familiar with its development.
